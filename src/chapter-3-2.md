In this chapter, we'll explore the steps businesses should take to prepare for AI implementation in sales and marketing, specifically evaluating data availability and quality.

Assessing Data Availability
---------------------------

Before implementing AI technology in sales and marketing, businesses must assess the availability of data they have on their customers. This includes understanding what data is available, where it's stored, and how accessible it is.

Some questions to consider when assessing data availability include:

* What data do we currently have on our customers?
* Where is our customer data stored?
* Is our customer data accessible and easily retrievable?
* Do we need to collect additional data to support AI implementation?

By answering these questions, businesses can determine whether they have sufficient data available to support AI implementation in sales and marketing.

Evaluating Data Quality
-----------------------

In addition to assessing data availability, businesses must also evaluate the quality of their data. This involves ensuring that data is accurate, complete, and relevant to the business's sales and marketing goals.

Some questions to consider when evaluating data quality include:

* How accurate is our customer data?
* Is our customer data up-to-date?
* Is our customer data complete?
* Is our customer data relevant to our sales and marketing goals?

By answering these questions, businesses can identify any gaps or issues in their data quality and take steps to address them before implementing AI technology in sales and marketing.
